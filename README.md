### `/docs`

The `docs` directory contains the documentation for the project, detailing different technical aspects and assessments:

- **`BoATechAssessPt1.html`**: Documentation for Part 1, focusing on the Cybersecurity Scenario. This document explores various cybersecurity challenges and solutions implemented in this project.

- **`B0ATechAssessPt2A.html`**: Documentation for Part 2A, covering Docker Security Best Practices. It includes guidelines and recommendations for securing Docker containers and ensuring a robust containerized environment.

- **`B0ATechAssessPt2B.html`**: Documentation for Part 2B, discussing Kubernetes Security Features. This section highlights the built-in security features of Kubernetes and how they can be leveraged to protect applications running in a Kubernetes cluster.

- **`B0ATechAssessPt2C.html`**: Documentation for Part 2C, which addresses Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Its Security Implications. This part examines the security considerations when using IaaS platforms and best practices for maintaining secure infrastructure.

- **`B0ATechAssessPt3.html`**: Documentation for Part 3, describing the Ansible playbook located in the `ansible` subfolder. This document provides a detailed explanation of how the playbook works, including tasks for deploying a web server and ensuring a secure setup.

### `/infrastructure`

This directory contains infrastructure-related files necessary for deploying and managing the application.

- **`Dockerfile`**: Used to build the Docker image for the application. Defines the environment and dependencies required to run the app in a container.

- **`Jenkinsfile`**: Defines the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline. It automates the build, test, and deployment processes.

#### `/infrastructure/kubernetes`

This subdirectory contains Kubernetes configuration files.

- **`deployment.yaml`**: Defines the deployment settings for running your application in a Kubernetes cluster, including replicas, image settings, and other deployment-specific configurations.

- **`service.yaml`**: Defines the Kubernetes service configuration that exposes your application, managing load balancing and access within the cluster.

#### `/infrastructure/ansible`

This subdirectory contains Ansible playbooks for automating server configuration and application deployment.

- **`deploy_webserver.yml`**: An Ansible playbook designed to deploy a web server. It includes tasks to install necessary packages, configure the server, and ensure the web server is running and accessible.

### Docker Usage

To build and run the Docker container, use the following commands:

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t your-image-name .

# Run Docker container
docker run -p 80:80 your-image-name
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

Deploy your application to a Kubernetes cluster with the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f infrastructure/kubernetes/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f infrastructure/kubernetes/service.yaml
```

### Ansible Deployment

Use the following command to execute the Ansible playbook and deploy the web server:

```bash
ansible-playbook infrastructure/ansible/deploy_webserver.yml
```
